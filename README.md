# Introduction to Deep Learning Exam Repo

The repository is only created for the purpose of an exam in Deep Learning in the Bachelor of Software Development @ UCL Odense, Denmark.

## Datasets used:

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset**  
   The first dataset used for the exam project is the **[Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)** dataset. Which is available from Scikit-Learn.

2. **Pawpularity PetFinder Dataset**  
   The next dataset is the **[PetFinder Pawpularity](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-pawpularity-score/overview)** dataset.
   
   

## Experiments

This repository includes experiments with:
- **Supervised Learning** models such as [Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ArmBVF2dCs), [Logistic Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8), [Decision Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y), and [Random Forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ).
- **Clustering** techniques like [K-Means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA) and [Hierchical Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHsRkOdVwo).
- **Dimensionality Reduction** using PCA.
- **Deep Learning Models** including [Neural Networks (NN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw) and [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwBXDKFk9I) on image datasets.

## Note:
The repository description is in English, but all the tasks (Opgaver) are in Danish.
